The previous code will throw “Deprecated: define(): Declaration of case-insensitive constants is deprecated”,
Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, also called PCRE is a library that PHP uses for dealing with Regular Expressions.PCRE to PCRE2 
PSRE2 is more strict in the pattern validations, so after the upgrade, some of your existing patterns could not compile anymore.
this probably is one of the most common causes of incompatibility you will encounter.


bcscale() can now also be used as getter to retrieve the current scale in use. Returns the old scale when used as setter. Otherwise the current scale is returned.

Support for full case-mapping and case-folding has been added.
mb_strtoupper("Straße");
// Produces STRAßE on PHP 7.2
// Produces STRASSE on PHP 7.3
mb_convert_case ( string $str , int $mode [, string $encoding = mb_internal_encoding() ] ) : string
mode
The mode of the conversion. It can be one of MB_CASE_UPPER, MB_CASE_LOWER, 
MB_CASE_TITLE, MB_CASE_FOLD, MB_CASE_UPPER_SIMPLE, MB_CASE_LOWER_SIMPLE, MB_CASE_TITLE_SIMPLE, MB_CASE_FOLD_SIMPLE.

print_r($result);

while ($foo) {
    switch ($bar) {
      case "baz":
         continue;
         // Warning: "continue" targeting switch is equivalent to
         //          "break". Did you mean to use "continue 2"?

In PHP, static properties are shared between inheriting classes, unless the static property is explicitly overridden in a child class.
TypeError now reports wrong types as int and bool instead of integer and boolean, respectively.

$city  = "San Francisco";
$state = "CA";
$event = "SIGGRAPH";

$location_vars = array("city", "state");

$result = compact("event", $location_vars);
print_r($result);

getimagesize() and related functions now report the mime type of BMP images as image/bmp instead of image/x-ms-bmp
stream_socket_get_name() will now return IPv6 addresses wrapped in brackets. For example "[::1]:1337" will be returned instead of "::1:1337".

Standard PHP Library (SPL)
If an SPL autoloader throws an exception, following autoloaders will not be executed. Previously all autoloaders were executed and exceptions were chained.

SimpleXML
Mathematic operations involving SimpleXML objects will now treat the text as an integer or float, whichever is more appropriate. Previously values were treated as integers unconditionally.
